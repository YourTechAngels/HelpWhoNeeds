            These are our Terms & Conditions. </p>
            <p>What’s covered in these terms </p>
           <p> We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, 
               but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, 
               and what we expect from you.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that our business works, the laws that apply to our company, 
and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service 
help define our relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, 
these terms include the following topic headings:</p>

    <p>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
    What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
    Content in services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find 
    in our services – whether that content belongs to you, us or others
    In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to 
    expect in case someone violates these terms.

Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage 
you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.
