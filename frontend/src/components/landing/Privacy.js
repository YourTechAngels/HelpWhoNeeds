    We collect data from you when you visit our websites or while using our associated apps (“websites and Apps”).

Data is collected when you place an order, call our Customer Care team, register with us, opt into our marketing communications, browse our site and use other services offered by our site. The data we collect is used to take your order, process payment and deliver your purchase to you. We also use it to deliver marketing communications, give access to services for registered users, personalize your visit to our site and provide assistance via our Customer Care team.

We must have a valid reason for processing your personal data and we may not collect, store or use data about you that is not compatible with that reason.
